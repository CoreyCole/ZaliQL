\begin{abstract}
Causal inference from observational data is a subject of active research and development in statistics and computer science. Many toolkits have been developed for this purpose that
 depends on  statistical software. However, these toolkits do not scale to large datasets. In this paper we  describe a suite of techniques for expressing causal inference tasks from observational data
  in SQL.  This suite supports the state-of-the-art methods for causal inference and run at scale
  within a database engine. In addition, we introduce
  several optimization techniques that significantly speedup causal
  inference, both in the online and offline setting.  We evaluate the quality and performance of our techniques by experiments of real datasets.
