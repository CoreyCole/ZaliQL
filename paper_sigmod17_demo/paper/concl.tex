\section{Conclusions}
In this demonstration, we introduce \GSQL: a tool for
performing causal inference
on large relational data within a DBMS. \GSQL\ makes the first step towards truly scalable causal inference by modeling it as a data management problem. \GSQL\ implements a wide range of methods for causal inference developed in statistics with existing techniques
in data management. This provides scalable evaluation of several causal hypotheses
on relational data. \ignore{\GSQL\ is optimized for PostgreSQL and also includes a visual interface to wrap around the framework.}
