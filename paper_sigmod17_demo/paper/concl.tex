\section{Conclusions}
In this demonstration we introduce \GSQL, which is aimed at
performing causal inference
on Big relational data within DBMS at scale. \GSQL\ made a first step towards truly scalable causal inference by modeling it as a data management problem. It leverages existing techniques
in data management to efficiently evaluate several causal hypotheses from Big relational data. \GSQL\ is written in PL/pgSQL and optimized for PostgreSQL. It also includes a visual interface to wrap around the framework.
