\section{Conclusions}
In this demonstration we introduce \GSQL, which is aimed at
performing causal inference
on large relational data within a DBMS. \GSQL\ makes a first step towards truly scalable causal inference by modeling it as a data management problem. It leverages existing techniques
in data management to efficiently evaluate several causal hypotheses
from relational data. \GSQL\ is optimized for PostgreSQL, and also includes a visual interface to wrap around the framework.
