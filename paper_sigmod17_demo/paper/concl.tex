\section{Conclusions}
IN this demonstration we introduce \GSQL, which is aimed at
performing causal inference
on Big relational data in DBMS. The primary contribution of \GSQL\ is to represent the main tasks involved with causal inference in SQL, in order to integrate causal analysis with other data analytic operations supported by DBMS.
In addition, \GSQL\ leverages existing techniques
in data management to efficiently assess several causal hypotheses (see Section \ref{sec:algo}). \GSQL\ is developed and released as a PostgreSQL extension. In addition, we designed a visual interface to wrap around the framework.
