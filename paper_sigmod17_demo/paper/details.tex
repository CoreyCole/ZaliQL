\section{Demonstration Details}

Task is to investigate performance of new version of PostgreSQL compared to
old. We use a workload based on SSB data. We are interested in read performance
so we generate simple select/project queries from a large fact table. We vary
selected columns, size of table, filtering predicates.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show some plots with Viska where some features $F_1$ through $F_k$ seem to
influence runtime.
\item Use Viska to show that a subset of these features are causes while others
are not causes.
\item Enable attendees to drill into the details of how we generate these
results (i.e.\, the different steps of the pipeline).
\item Show what happens for different configurations of the Viska system:
e.g.\, different parameters to graph-generation algorithms, different bucketing
strategies, etc.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Performance Data.}

Viska generates and analyzes performance data obtained by benchmarking
systems. This performance data consists of a set of records
each representing a single execution of an experiment. This record has
a set of ``input'' variables that we vary between experiments, such as
type of queries run, data set used, or configuration parameters. Viska
records these along with a set of ``observed'' variables: properties
of the execution (e.g., number of rows processed), system-level
metrics (e.g., CPU and disk utilization), and outcome variables (e.g.,
query execution time).

The Viska toolkit includes tools to generate and analyze this
performance data. We do not describe the tools for workload
generation, system deployment, and metric gathering here.
