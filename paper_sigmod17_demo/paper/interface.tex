\section{The interface}
\label{sec:inter}
\subsection{Graphical} 
The web GUI (see Figure \ref{fig:inteface}) is configured with the user's databases URL after they have installed the \GSQL\ Postgres extension.
It can be hosted remotely on a server or locally on your machine.
The interface consists of three tabs: Setup, Matching Summary, and Analysis.
The {\em Setup} tab allows the user to specify their Treatments, Covariates for each treatment, and Outcomes.
Clicking on the {\it ADD TREATMENT}, {\it ADD COVARIATE}, and {\it ADD OUTCOME} buttons will trigger a dialog allowing
  further customization on the discritization and matching methods.
These dialogs will also allow the user to incorporate other columns (e.g. snow is defined as $iff Precipm> 0.3 and
Tempm< 0$) and input SQL for custom discritization methods.

\subsection{API} 
The API will consist of stored procedures that are accessible after installing the \GSQL\ extension.
These are written in PL/pgSQL and are optimized for Postgres DBMS.
The functionality of the API is modeled after the MatchIt R library \cite{ho2005}.
