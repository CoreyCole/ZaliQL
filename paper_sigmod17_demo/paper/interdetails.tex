The demonstration starts with weather and flight data.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it Selecting a causal hypothesis:} the attendee selects a causal hypothesis to test by
specifying a treatment(potential cause) and an outcome (potential effect) as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inteface}. We restrict the demonstration to binary treatments and outcomes.

\item {\it Selecting a Matching method:} The user select and tune the matching algorithm that \GSQL will uses to improve covariate balance as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inteface}(b). ...

\item {\it Checking Balance:} The user asses how the matching methods was successful. To this end \GSQL \ provides a number of ways to assess the balance of covariates after matching, including numerical summaries such as the mean Diff. (difference in means), and summaries based on quantile quantile plots and multivariate histograms that compare the empirical distributions of each covariate as shown in Figure \ref{fig:inteface}(c). 
     
\item {\it Conducting analysis after matching:}  At this step \GSQL\  performs a Chi-square test to detect significant differences between the treated and control group in the macthed dataset obtained from the previous step.



\end{enumerate}


The demonstration will automatically walk through all of the key steps involved with causal inference.  ...
