Causal inference from observational data is a subject of active research and development in statistics and computer science. Many toolkits have been developed for this purpose that depend on statistical software.
However, these toolkits do not scale to large datasets.
We propose and demonstrate \GSQL: a SQL-based framework for drawing causal inference from observational data.
\GSQL\ supports the state-of-the-art methods for causal inference and runs at scale within a database engine.
\ignore{In addition, \GSQL\ includes several optimization techniques that significantly speedup causal inference, in both online and offline settings.} \GSQL\ is designed as an extension for PostgreSQL object-relational database system. In addition, we designed a visual interface to wrap around \GSQL\  to demonstrate the causal effect of different weather conditions on flight delays.
