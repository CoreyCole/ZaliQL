Causal inference from observational data is a subject of active research and development in statistics and computer science. Many toolkits have been developed for this purpose that
 depends on  statistical software. However, these toolkits do not scale to large datasets. We propose \GSQL \ a SQL-based framework  for causal inference from observational data.  \GSQL \ supports the state-of-the-art methods for causal inference and run at scale
  within a database engine. In addition, \GSQL includes
  several optimization techniques that significantly speedup causal
  inference, both in the online and offline setting.  We desined a visual interface to wrap around this framework 
  and demonstrate \GSQL\  for quantifying the effect of different weather condition of flight delay.
