Causal inference from observational data is a subject of active research and development in statistics and computer science.
\corey{citations here?}
Many toolkits have been developed for this purpose that depend on statistical software.
However, these toolkits do not scale to large datasets.
We propose \GSQL\ a SQL-based framework for causal inference from observational data.
\GSQL\ supports the state-of-the-art methods for causal inference and run at scale within a database engine.
In addition, \GSQL\ includes several optimization techniques that significantly speedup causal inference, in both online and offline settings.
Finally, we desined a visual interface to wrap around this framework and demonstrate \GSQL\ for quantifying the effect of different weather conditions on flight delays.
