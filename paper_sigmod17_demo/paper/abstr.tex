From CFP: Selection of demonstrations for presentation at SIGMOD is highly
competitive. The evaluation criteria includes both the audience experience and
the novelty of the system. The proposal should also describe in detail what
SIGMOD attendees who view the demonstration will experience. What exactly will
the audience see? Will they be able to interact with the system? Is there an
interesting scenario or script that the demonstrators will use to motivate the
demonstration? Authors may include a description of the novel intellectual
content of the underlying system and of its architecture. The demonstration
proposal must include citations of the most relevant papers about the proposed
system and any previous publications of that same system. Priority will be
given to systems that have never been demonstrated before. One of the
demonstrations will be selected to receive an award of Best Demo.
