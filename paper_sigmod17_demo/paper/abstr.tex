Causal inference from observational data is a subject of active research and development in statistics and computer science. Many toolkits have been developed for this purpose that depend on statistical software.
However, these toolkits do not scale to large datasets.
We propose and demonstrate \GSQL\ a SQL-based framework for causal inference from observational data.
\GSQL\ supports the state-of-the-art methods for causal inference and run at scale within a database engine.
In addition, \GSQL\ includes several optimization techniques that significantly speedup causal inference, in both online and offline settings. \GSQL\ is designed as an extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database system. Finally,  designed a visual interface to wrap around this it and demonstrate \GSQL\ for quantifying the effect of different weather conditions on flight delays.
